U!C Static Analyzer for C Programs: Catching Segmentation Faults

The U!C static analyzer is a powerful tool designed specifically for analyzing C programs to identify potential 
segmentation faults before they occur during runtime. By employing advanced static analysis techniques, U!C examines the code without executing it,
allowing developers to uncover vulnerabilities related to memory access and pointer usage.

Key Features:
Comprehensive Code Analysis: The analyzer inspects the entire codebase, scanning for common patterns that lead to segmentation faults, such as:

Dereferencing null or uninitialized pointers
Buffer overflows
Out-of-bounds array access
Invalid pointer arithmetic
Detailed Reporting: U!C provides detailed reports that highlight:

The specific lines of code where potential segmentation faults may occur.
A description of the identified issue, along with its implications.
Suggestions for code improvements to mitigate the risks.
Integration with Development Workflows: The static analyzer can be easily integrated into existing development environments, 
including IDEs and CI/CD pipelines, enabling real-time feedback during coding and testing phases.

Customizable Rules: Users can customize the analysis rules based on their coding standards and project requirements, allowing for a tailored approach to error detection.

Performance Optimization: U!C employs efficient algorithms to minimize the time taken for analysis, ensuring that it does not significantly impact the development workflow.

User-Friendly Interface: The analyzer features an intuitive interface that makes it easy for developers of all levels to navigate and interpret the results.
